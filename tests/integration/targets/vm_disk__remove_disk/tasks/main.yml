# This is a part of the vm module; testing vm disk remove
# disk remove might require VM to be shutdown, or maybe VM can remain running.
# Module should shutdown VM only if it is allowed to shutdown (force_reboot=True) and
# if disk cannot be removed without shutdown.

# Test with IDE disk, remove fails much faster compared to virtio disk (2 vs 60 sec).

major_changes:
  - Allow changing VM `machine_type` using vm and vm_param modules.
    (https://github.com/ScaleComputing/HyperCoreAnsibleCollection/pull/287)
minor_changes:
  - Fix `vm_rebooted` output value.
    The meaning needs to be "was VM rebooted".
    Some modules were still returning "VM needs to be rebooted (if it is running) to apply (some) changes".
  - vm_nic module fails with descriptive message (no crash) if VM is missing.
